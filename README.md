Steps to run this project locally:

* How to get API keys:
    * [Openweathermap key](https://openweathermap.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/1626888-how-to-get-api-key)
    * [Google maps key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

* Clone repo and open project folder in terminal

    ``` git clone https://github.com/jeevan-jp/MyL3-External-Data.git ```

* A local webserver is needed (for error free viewing), http-server is a good option.
Install http-server globally using the following command:

    ``` npm install http-server -g ```

    Mac and Linux users may need to add sudo at the beginning:

    ``` sudo npm install http-server -g ```

    If npm isn't working [download and install node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

* After installation type the following command in terminal:

    ``` http-server -p 3000 ```

* Type ```http://localhost:3000``` in your browser address bar and hit enter.
